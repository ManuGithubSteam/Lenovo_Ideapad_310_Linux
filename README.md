Tipps and expiriences with the Lenovo Ideapad 310 with Linux

# Why

(2017) The Lenovo Ideapad 310 is a reasonable good machine from Lenovo and it is available in may configurations, from mid range gaming with Nvidia over mutlimedia with dvd player to office configurations. On youtube there are many tutorials on how to upgrade the 310 and it is well reciefed by review portals (75% - 85% in the Ratings)

So it has many usecases. However as I researched I could not find a good howto for Linux in this laptop series from Lenovo. So I'm writing my own one. As i will fit this machine for a friend who is a beginner in Linux i will also focus on makeing the Linux expirinence smooth as possible for new Linux users.

# (Anticipated) Problems:

As I researched this laptop it became apparent, that there are not many posts about in in the Linux world.
This could mean that, not many problems are to be expected wich would be a good thing. 

However as only the Lenovo T and X series are shipped to RedHat and other big companies it does mean other model series do not neccarrily work as good with Linux.

The List of expected Problems:
- Secure Boot
- TPM
- Sound Issue (found on the Net )
- Wlan connection issues ( Found on the Net )
- UEFI ?
- Yoga desater (RAID Controler?)

# Software

I will use the newest Kubuntu 17.04 for this Laptop. The reasion beeing, Ubuntu is still top notch in term of drivers for newer Hardware and of course do these changes tickle into other Distros and i certainly could get them to work but my reasoing is, that my friend should be able to update the system by iself and don't worry about manually installed drivers and config hacks.

KDE is the obvious choice as it is more intuitive for an ex-Windows user as for instead say Gnome. I won't go into Unity. Reason are all over the Internet. 

Also Plasma 5 from KDE offers some cool feature to make the workflow more powerfull and easy at the same time.
