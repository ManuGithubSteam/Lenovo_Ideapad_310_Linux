Tipps and expiriences with the Lenovo Ideapad 310 with Linux

# Why

(2017) The Lenovo Ideapad 310 is a reasonable good machine from Lenovo and it is available in may configurations, from mid range gaming with Nvidia over mutlimedia with dvd player to office configurations. On youtube there are many tutorials on how to upgrade the 310 and it is well reciefed by review portas (75% - 85% in the Ratings)

So it has many usecases. However as i researched i could not find a good Howto for Linux in this Laptop Series from Lenovo. So I'm writing my own one. As i will fit this machine for a friend who is a beginner in Linux i will also focus on makeing the Linux expirinence smooth as possible for new Linux users.

# Hardware

As my friend will use the Laptop mostly for multimedia, i did choose a configuration with a dvd plaxer.
Specificly i choose this one: https://www.amazon.de/Lenovo-ideapad-Notebook-i5-7200U-DVD-Brenner/dp/B01MTY2HTD/ref=sr_1_1?s=computers&ie=UTF8&qid=1492260062&sr=1-1&keywords=Lenovo+ideapad+310+ssd+dvd
